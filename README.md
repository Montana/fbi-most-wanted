- Search by field office
- Paginated results
- Custom search by crime type, nationality, and age range
- Rate limiting handling with exponential backoff
- Error handling for network and JSON parsing issues

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- requests library (`pip install requests`)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
```
## Install Dependencies

pip install requests
```
## Usage

The script includes four example functions:

`basic_example()`: Shows total count and first wanted person

`search_by_field_office()`: Searches Miami field office

`paginated_example()`: Gets page 2 of results

`custom_search_example()`: Searches with specific criteria

You can also import and use the `FBIMostWantedAPI` class in your own code:

```python3
from fbi import FBIMostWantedAPI

api = FBIMostWantedAPI()

# Basic list
data = api.get_wanted_list()

# Search with parameters
data = api.search_by_criteria(
    crime_type="Violent Crime",
    nationality="American",
    age_min=25,
    age_max=40
)
```

Available search parameters include:

`field_offices`: FBI field office (e.g., "miami")

`page`: Page number for pagination
